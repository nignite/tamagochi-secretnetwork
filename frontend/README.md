**Live demo available [here](https://tamagotchi-webapp-23uzp.ondigitalocean.app/)**  
The demo is using the pulsar-1 testnet along with a preconfigured wallet which has some coins on it for simplicity.

## Info

This pet is set to live for 48h and can be fed after 1 minute. By clicking on the right button you will be sending 10uscrt which will be exchanged for Food tokens in a 1/100 ratio. The left button will feed 10 Food tokens to the Pet. Feeding will result in burning the same tokens.

### Local

To run this locally you will need uploaded and properly configured contracts.  
After uploading and instantiating all contracts, input your wallet address and the contract's.
